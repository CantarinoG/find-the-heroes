# Where's Waldo with Superheroes

### Overview

This project is an interactive photo tagging game inspired by the classic 'Where's Wally?' (or 'Where's Waldo?' in the US). Built with React.js, it challenges players to find three specific superheroes hidden within a detailed image. The game combines visual acuity with time-based competition, encouraging users to achieve the fastest completion time and compete for a spot on the leaderboard.

### Features

- **Hero Search**: Find three specific superheroes hidden in a large, detailed image filled with other characters.
- **Timer**: The game starts with a timer that tracks how long it takes the player to find all three heroes.
- **Leaderboard**: Submit your score upon completion and view the top 10 fastest times(powered by Firebase).

### How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking on the "START" button.
2. Click on the heroes as you find them.
3. Once all heroes are found, submit your score (time) to the leaderboard.
4. Check the leaderboard to see how your score compares with others.
